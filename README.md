Hey there!
I’m Christer Holm, originally from the charming town of Ronneby, but I’ve made the leap to the mighty Hofors.  Moving from a place known for its nature and peacefulness to a town known for its steel industry — talk about a shift in gears!

I’m a programming language enthusiast and the founder of CodeForged Tech. I’ve got experience with a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here’s a quick peek at my toolkit:

I love building things, experimenting with new tech, and solving tricky problems. Whether it’s frontend magic ✨ or backend wizardry 🧙‍♂️, I’m ready to dive in!

When I'm not wrestling with code, you can probably find me exploring my new surroundings in Hofors or perfecting the art of Coffee.

Let’s build something awesome together!
