Hey there!
I‚Äôm Christer Holm, originally from the charming town of Ronneby, but I‚Äôve made the leap to the mighty Hofors.  Moving from a place known for its nature and peacefulness to a town known for its steel industry ‚Äî talk about a shift in gears!

I‚Äôm a programming language enthusiast and the founder of CodeForged Tech. I‚Äôve got experience with a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here‚Äôs a quick peek at my toolkit:

Languages:

Python ,
JavaScript, 
C# ,
Java , 
Swift ,
Kotlin ,
PHP ,
Ruby ,
TypeScript,
Dart
Go, 

Frameworks & Libraries:

React,
Angular, 
Vue.js,
Node.js, 
Django,
Flask,
ASP.NET,
Spring Boot, 
Express.js, 
next.js,
Laravel, 
Bootstrap, 
Tailwind CSS 

I love building things, experimenting with new tech, and solving tricky problems. Whether it‚Äôs frontend magic ‚ú® or backend wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, I‚Äôm ready to dive in!

When I'm not wrestling with code, you can probably find me exploring my new surroundings in Hofors or perfecting the art of Coffee.

Let‚Äôs build something awesome together!
