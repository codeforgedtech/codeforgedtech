Hey there!
I’m Christer Holm, originally from the charming town of Ronneby, but I’ve made the leap to the mighty Hofors.  Moving from a place known for its nature and peacefulness to a town known for its steel industry — talk about a shift in gears!

I’m a programming language enthusiast and the founder of CodeForged Tech. I’ve got experience with a wide variety of programming languages and frameworks. Here’s a quick peek at my toolkit:

Languages:

Python 
JavaScript 
C# ⚙
Java 
Swift 
Kotlin 
PHP 
Ruby 
TypeScript 

Frameworks & Libraries:

React
Angular 
Vue.js
Node.js 
Django 
Flask
ASP.NET 
Spring Boot 
Express.js 
Laravel 
Bootstrap 
Tailwind CSS 

I love building things, experimenting with new tech, and solving tricky problems. Whether it’s frontend magic ✨ or backend wizardry 🧙‍♂️, I’m ready to dive in!

When I'm not wrestling with code, you can probably find me exploring my new surroundings in Hofors or perfecting the art of fika. ☕🍰

Let’s build something awesome together!
